function CurrentCode()  --- Everytime we create a part, we have to do what follows in this function.
   local Brick = workspace.Brick
   local Part = Instance.new("Part") --- or Instance.new("Part", workspace) with workspace being its parent.
   Part.Parent = workspace
   Part.Name = "Wings"
   Part.Color = Color3.new(1, 1, 1) --- White
   Part.CFrame = Brick.CFrame
end


--------

function CreateProperties(part, parent, name, color, Otherpart) --- Similar to the code above, but is only written once, while the..
   part.Parent = parent --- .. the code written above must be written every single time we want to create an object.
   part.Name = name
   part.Color = color
   part.CFrame = Otherpart.CFrame
   return part --- Gives the information back.
end


function AdjustedCode() --- This will call another function to do built just like the code above, except all we have to do from now on is..
   local Brick = workspace.Brick --- .. give this funciton the values for each part we create to reduce time.
   local Part = Instance.new("Part")
   CreateProperties(Part, workspace, "Wings", Color3.new(1, 1, 1), Brick) --- The function we are calling to "do work."
